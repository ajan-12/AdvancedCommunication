Advanced communication methods for your Spigot server!

* Privately messsage a player in the server.
   * You can focus on a player and so you won't need to type /msg <player> every time you want to message.
   * After you focus, you can simply write your message like you're chatting and only the focus-ed player will see it!
   
* Spy on private messages made by players and console.(FOR ADMIN PURPOSES)
   
* Mention any player by adding a '@' to their name.
