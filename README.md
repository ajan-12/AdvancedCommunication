* Privately messsage a player in the server.
  * You can focus on a player and so you won't need to type /msg <player> every time you want to message.
  * After you focus, you can simply write your message like you're chatting and only the focus-ed player will see it!
   
* Spy on private messages made by players and console.(FOR ADMIN PURPOSES)
   
* Mention any player by adding a '@' to their name.
  * Notifies the mentioned player by:
    * A title on their screen.
    * An actionbar message.
    * A sound effect.
    * An highlighted message in chat.
  * Spam mentioning is prevented by a cooldown system of 10 seconds.

* Create groups to easily and privately message with all your friends more easily.
  * A ranking system in groups(group admin) to handle the groups.
